# Youtube-Scraper-DataBank

This repository is dedicated to the final project of the "Databases 1" course at the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro (UFRJ).

It contains a Conceptual Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD), a Logical diagram, and includes a Physical implementation in MySQL for a database that stores information about trending YouTube videos.

The data scraper we are using is heavily inspired by [Mitchell](https://github.com/mitchelljy)'s [Trending YouTube Scraper GitHub repository](https://github.com/mitchelljy/Trending-YouTube-Scraper).

Any additional bibliography is cited in the `main.pdf` file.
