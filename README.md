# -Youtube-Scrapper-DataBank

This repository is dedicated to the final project of the "Databases 1" course at the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro.

It contains a Conceptual Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD) and will include Logical and Physical Data Models for a database that stores information about trending YouTube videos.

The data scraper we are using is heavily inspired by Mitchell's Trending YouTube Scraper GitHub repository.
