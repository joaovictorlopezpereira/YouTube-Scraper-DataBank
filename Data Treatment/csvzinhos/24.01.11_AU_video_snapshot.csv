How To Build A Shelf Between Two Walls,131669,4712552,"Here’s the fastest and easiest way to build a shelf between two walls.Using a level, I mark a line on all three walls at the bottom of the shelf.And yes- a laser would work great for this, but I want to show how you can do basic jobs with simple tools.Next, I measure the depth of the shelves and cut two cleats out of 2x4s- I left room to add a face board later.Then I cut 4 more 2x4s to run between the cleats, making a ladder wall.Three-inch deck screws work great for jobs like this- I put two per stud.It’s important to measure the width of the shelf at the back wall and at the front because it can vary.I screw the frame to the wall making sure to hit studs- that’s not going anywhere.Now let’s cut the plywood- no fancy track saw, no problem. Just clamp down a straight board to use as a guide.After dry fitting the plywood, I could see there was a bulge on the side wall keeping the shelf from sliding all the way back.So, I use my pencil like a scribe, now I can cut the plywood to fit the wall.I apply liquid nails to the frame and set the shelf down- fits like a glove.Next, I load 1 ¾” trim nails into my 15-gauge trim gun to shoot it down.I measure with a tape- making sure to hit the frame.When I cut the face board, I use a 2-degree bevel, this way it’s a little longer in the front than the back and makes it fit super snug (you can see here what a good fit I got).Don’t worry -The nail holes get filled before it’s painted.At this point I was so tired I decided to take a nap.And then, the New Guy actually came out of his office to paint it for me.Be sure to like and follow (subscribe) for more content like this. @hausplans#build #howto #carpentry #framing #construction #diy #contractor #tools",1455,2024-11-01,AmZleTKYYQI

You’ll also get 20% off an annual premium subscription.--Dragon Age: The Veilguard is a collosal disappointment. It apes the most superficial elements of a Bioware game, making no effort to modernize what is a now fairly dated formula, while delivering absolutely none of writing, characterization, rpg depth and imagination that made previous Bioware games so great.

The True Scale Of Modern Nuclear Weapons,50015,3613180,"The terrifying true scale of modern nuclear weapons is beyond what most people can imagine. Nuclear Weapons today are far more powerful than those used in World War II. For example, the B83 nuclear bomb, the largest in the U.S. arsenal, is 80 times more powerful than the bomb dropped on Hiroshima. This single Nuclear Weapon could destroy an entire city like Beijing, causing millions of deaths and injuries.Submarine-launched missiles like the Trident II carry multiple Nuclear Weapons. Each missile can deliver up to eight warheads, each 30 times more powerful than the Hiroshima bomb. A single Trident II could devastate a city like Moscow, resulting in over 2.8 million immediate fatalities.China's Dongfeng 5 missile is another example of the terrifying power of Nuclear Weapons. It can carry up to 12 warheads, each 66 times more powerful than the Hiroshima bomb. If aimed at a city like Washington, D.C., the impact would be catastrophic, with over a million fatalities.Russia's R-36 missile, known as the Satan missile, can carry multiple Nuclear Weapons with immense destructive power. Some versions can deliver a single warhead up to 20 megatons, which is over 1,300 times the Hiroshima bomb.At the top of the list is Russia's RS-28 Sarmat missile, nicknamed Satan 2. This Nuclear Weapon can carry up to 15 warheads and potentially deliver a 50-megaton bomb, causing unimaginable destruction to cities like New York.Even though some countries may face setbacks, the existence of these Nuclear Weapons means that even a few could cause unimaginable damage. The true scale of modern Nuclear Weapons shows that in a nuclear war, there are no winners—only devastating loss for humanity.Sources:https://nuclearsecrecy.com/nukemap/U.S. Department of Energy https://www.energy.gov/National Museum of the U.S. Air Force https://www.nationalmuseum.af.mil/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_weaponSubscribe to Science Time: https://www.youtube.com/sciencetime24#nukes #sciencetime #nuclearwinter",7849,2024-11-01,ujfC0NgdU48

Dua Lipa: Tiny Desk Concert,152981,4337977,"Stephen Thompson | October 25, 2024When Dua Lipa came to visit the Tiny Desk, she had nothing to prove — and much to live up to. After all, the singer’s Tiny Desk (home) concert, recorded in London in the aftermath of her 2020 blockbuster Future Nostalgia, still holds the record for the most-viewed Tiny Desk concert in history, her 130 million views surpassing even the likes of Mac Miller and Anderson .Paak. Four years later, the pop superstar finally graced the actual Tiny Desk, this time armed with four warm and inviting songs from Radical Optimism. Arriving in the first half of this year — when the dominant storylines in music so often revolved around grievances and rivalries — Radical Optimism stood out for its comparatively sunny and forgiving takes on failed and failing relationships, seduction, new love and old wounds. And, of course, it dispensed a world-beating banger in “Houdini,” which joins past Dua Lipa classics (“New Rules,” “Levitating,” “Don’t Start Now”) on her own personal Mount Rushmore.Befitting an artist whose newest songs often reflect the pursuit of personal growth — see: “Happy for You” — Lipa and her team breezed through the NPR Music offices with a mix of low-drama professionalism and unmistakable warmth. We’ve dealt with a lot of stars (and their teams) over the years, and as often as people ask us to dish about people who’ve been difficult, we’ve mostly accumulated stories of people who’ve been lovely to have around. Even among all those, Lipa and her people stood out: They were kind, gracious, fun and game.That shows up on camera, too, as you’ll see here.

The Vanquish has seen several other changes over its previous iteration, including a new chassis with a longer wheelbase and a higher top speed of 344 kph (214 mph). But does it provide the driving experience you might expect of a full-fledged Aston Martin halo car? And with only a few choices for a new V12 on the market, how does it compare to its similarly-engined competitors? Thomas and James are excited to find out! We hope you enjoy the episode.

I try to beat the game, while my anonymous friend tries everything he can to stop me. This is all custom coded by us. If this video somehow gets 1,000,000 likes we'll announce the date of the next episode early.Not Minecraft, But Water Rises or Minecraft, But Lava Rises, or any other but challenge like that.
